the “Configure Session Timeout” modal is opening but the screen is still way too dark. That’s just the default shadcn/radix overlay. Here’s exactly how to fix it and make it match the Change-Password modal (light overlay, crisp panel, correct stacking), plus a quick sanity check for the sessions table.
A) Make the overlay light and the panel sit above it
Where: your UI Dialog wrapper (shadcn’s default lives at client/src/components/ui/dialog.tsx).
If you don’t have a central wrapper, update the DialogPrimitive.Overlay and DialogPrimitive.Content for the Session Timeout dialog.
Change these classes:
Overlay:
from: bg-black/80 (or similar)
to: bg-black/30 md:bg-black/20 backdrop-blur-[1px] z-40
Content:
ensure: z-50 bg-white shadow-xl rounded-xl (and not z-40)
add a subtle border: border border-slate-200
Example (shadcn default edit):
// dialog.tsx
<DialogPrimitive.Overlay
  className="fixed inset-0 z-40 bg-black/30 md:bg-black/20 backdrop-blur-[1px] data-[state=open]:animate-in data-[state=closed]:animate-out"
/>
<DialogPrimitive.Content
  className="fixed z-50 grid w-full max-w-md gap-4 rounded-xl border border-slate-200 bg-white p-6 shadow-xl"
>
  {/* ... */}
</DialogPrimitive.Content>
Why it was so dark: the default overlay is bg-black/80. Also, if content and overlay share the same z-index, the overlay can visually “sit on” the panel.
Also check (common gotchas):
No parent element of the modal has transform/filter (creates a new stacking context). If your page wrapper has transform, either remove it or bump z-50 on content and z-40 on overlay.
Ensure the modal open state closes properly so the overlay unmounts (shadcn handles it, but if you wrapped it, make sure you pass onOpenChange).
B) Use the same modal wrapper as Change Password
If your Change-Password dialog already looks right, reuse its wrapper:
Pull its Dialog, DialogContent, and DialogHeader components into a shared <Modal> and use that for the Session Timeout dialog. The style will match automatically.
C) “Active Sessions” still empty? Quick store sanity check
I saw in the logs a query against sessions. With connect-pg-simple, the default table name is "session" (no “s”). If your endpoint uses the plural, it will always return 0 rows.
Make sure your queries use the correct table:
SELECT sid, expire, (sess::jsonb -> 'meta') AS meta
FROM "session"     -- not sessions
WHERE (sess::jsonb ->> 'userId') = $1;
On login, save meta + session:
req.session.userId = user.id;
req.session.meta = {
  ua: req.get('user-agent') || '',
  ip: req.ip,
  createdAt: Date.now(),
  lastSeen: Date.now(),
};
await new Promise(res => req.session.save(res));
On each authed request, update lastSeen:
app.use((req, _res, next) => {
  if (req.session?.userId) {
    const m = (req.session as any).meta || {};
    (req.session as any).meta = { ...m, lastSeen: Date.now() };
    req.session.save(() => next());
  } else next();
});
With that, View Sessions should list at least your current session, and Active Sessions ≠ 0.
