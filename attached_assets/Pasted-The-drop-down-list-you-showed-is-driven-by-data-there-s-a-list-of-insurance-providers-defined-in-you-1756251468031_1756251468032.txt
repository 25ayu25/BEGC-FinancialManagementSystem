The drop‑down list you showed is driven by data—there’s a list of insurance providers defined in your code and/or database. In the current repository the constants file and seed script define only six providers (CIC, UAP, CIGNA, Nile International, New Sudan Insurance and Amaanah Insurance). However, your production site has extra entries such as “Jubilee Insurance,” “Cash Payment” and “ALIMA,” which means the database still contains those records.
To show only the seven insurance providers you need, update both the code and the database:

Update the client constants. In client/src/lib/constants.ts, replace the current INSURANCE_PROVIDERS object with the desired list. For example:
export const INSURANCE_PROVIDERS = {
  CIC:   { name: 'CIC Insurance',      code: 'CIC' },
  UAP:   { name: 'UAP Insurance',      code: 'UAP' },
  CIGNA: { name: 'CIGNA Insurance',    code: 'CIGNA' },
  NEW_SUDAN: { name: 'New Sudan Insurance', code: 'NEW_SUDAN' },
  AMANAH: { name: 'Amanah Insurance',  code: 'AMANAH' },
  ALIMA: { name: 'ALIMA Insurance',    code: 'ALIMA' },
  OTHER: { name: 'Other',              code: 'OTHER' },
} as const;
Remove the NILE_INTERNATIONAL entry and ensure spelling matches what you want to display.
Update the server seed. In server/seed.ts, modify the insuranceProviders array to include only the seven providers above. Remove any unwanted providers (e.g. Nile International) and add entries for ALIMA and “Other” with their codes.
Clean up the database. Use your database (Supabase or Postgres) to remove or deactivate the unwanted records. You can run SQL similar to:
DELETE FROM insurance_providers
WHERE code NOT IN ('CIC', 'UAP', 'CIGNA', 'NEW_SUDAN', 'AMANAH', 'ALIMA', 'OTHER');

-- optionally ensure the seven providers exist:
INSERT INTO insurance_providers (code, name)
  VALUES ('ALIMA','ALIMA Insurance'), ('OTHER','Other')
ON CONFLICT (code) DO NOTHING;
Alternatively, if your backend code uses createInsuranceProvider(), you can call that method to insert the missing providers and deactivate unwanted ones.
Redeploy both services. After updating the code and database, redeploy the backend (Render) and frontend (Netlify). Clearing any cached data in the browser will help ensure the updated list loads.
By aligning the constants, seed script and database table with your desired list of providers, the “Add New Transaction” drop‑down will only show CIC Insurance, UAP Insurance, CIGNA Insurance, New Sudan Insurance, Amanah Insurance, ALIMA Insurance and Other.

To add Nile International Insurance (and ensure the list of providers matches what you need), you don’t have to hunt through every file—only a few specific places control which providers appear:
Client constants – the drop‑down in the front‑end pulls from client/src/lib/constants.ts. The current file defines the insurance providers list. You should add entries for “ALIMA Insurance” and “Other,” and ensure “Nile International” and “Amanah/Amaanah” are spelled and coded as you expect. For example:
export const INSURANCE_PROVIDERS = {
  CIC:   { name: 'CIC Insurance',       code: 'CIC' },
  UAP:   { name: 'UAP Insurance',       code: 'UAP' },
  CIGNA: { name: 'CIGNA Insurance',     code: 'CIGNA' },
  NILE_INTERNATIONAL: { name: 'Nile International Insurance', code: 'NILE' },
  NEW_SUDAN:  { name: 'New Sudan Insurance',  code: 'NEW_SUDAN' },
  AMANAH:    { name: 'Amanah Insurance',    code: 'AMANAH' },   // choose the spelling you prefer
  ALIMA:     { name: 'ALIMA Insurance',     code: 'ALIMA' },
  OTHER:     { name: 'Other',               code: 'OTHER' }
} as const;
Server seed – the back‑end seeds the insurance_providers table in server/seed.ts. At the moment it only inserts six providers, so “ALIMA” and “Other” never make it into the database. Update the insuranceProviders array in this file to include Nile International (if it isn’t already), ALIMA and Other, and adjust the Amanah spelling if needed. The server uses storage.createInsuranceProvider() to add these, so reseeding or manually inserting them will make them appear when the UI calls /api/insurance-providers.
Database – because the site fetches providers from the database via /api/insurance-providers, updating the constants alone won’t fix the drop‑down; you also need to add the missing providers and remove unwanted ones in your database. If you’re using Supabase or Render/Postgres, run a migration or execute SQL to ensure only the desired codes exist, for example:
-- Remove unwanted providers
DELETE FROM insurance_providers
WHERE code NOT IN ('CIC','UAP','CIGNA','NILE','NEW_SUDAN','AMANAH','ALIMA','OTHER');

-- Insert missing providers if they don’t already exist
INSERT INTO insurance_providers (code, name) VALUES
  ('NILE','Nile International Insurance'),
  ('AMANAH','Amanah Insurance'),
  ('ALIMA','ALIMA Insurance'),
  ('OTHER','Other')
ON CONFLICT (code) DO NOTHING;
Optional SQL template – if you rely on the supabase-tables.sql file to initialize your database, update its INSERT INTO insurance_providers section to include the eight providers instead of the old list.
