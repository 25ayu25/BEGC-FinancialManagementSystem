You’re right to be frustrated. Two separate things are tripping you up in production, and the agent kept fixing them one-by-one instead of closing both at the same time:
What the agent kept missing
Your frontend is sometimes calling Netlify instead of your Render API.
When that happens the response is Netlify’s HTML (<!doctype html>…), and your code tries to JSON.parse it — hence the error:
“Unexpected token ‘<’, ‘<!DOCTYPE’… is not valid JSON”
This is a build-time config issue (bad/missing VITE_API_URL) or a bad default that falls back to window.location.origin. The requests then go to https://…netlify.app/api/... instead of https://bgc-financialmanagementsystem.onrender.com/api/....
Even when the requests do hit your Render API, the session cookie isn’t sent cross-site.
Your cookie is sameSite: 'lax', so browsers do not include it for cross-site XHR/fetch (Netlify → Render). That produces the 401s you saw on /api/departments and /api/insurance-providers.
Fix both and everything (dropdowns, overview, user creation) works.
Do these 6 fixes exactly
1) Frontend: force the API base URL (no fallback to window)
File: client/src/lib/queryClient.ts (or where you create your axios/fetch client)
import axios from "axios";

const baseURL =
  import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL ??
  "https://bgc-financialmanagementsystem.onrender.com"; // hard fallback

export const api = axios.create({
  baseURL,
  withCredentials: true, // send cookies
});
If you have any other clients, make them all use this same api.
2) Netlify: environment variables
In Site settings → Build & deploy → Environment, set:
VITE_API_URL = https://bgc-financialmanagementsystem.onrender.com
VITE_ENVIRONMENT = production
Click Save, then Trigger deploy (redeploy the site).
3) Backend: cookie options for cross-site
Where you set the login cookie (auth route):
import type { CookieOptions } from "express";
const isProd = process.env.NODE_ENV === "production";

const cookieOpts: CookieOptions = {
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: isProd,       // Render is HTTPS
  sameSite: "none",     // <-- REQUIRED for Netlify -> Render
  path: "/",
  maxAge: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 30, // 30 days
  // If later you move both to one domain, set COOKIE_DOMAIN and use:
  // domain: process.env.COOKIE_DOMAIN
};

res.cookie("user_session", sessionToken, cookieOpts);
Logout must clear with the same attributes:
res.clearCookie("user_session", { ...cookieOpts, maxAge: undefined });
res.json({ ok: true });
And keep:
app.set("trust proxy", 1);
4) Backend: CORS that truly allows Netlify + credentials
In server/app.ts:
import cors from "cors";

const allowList = (process.env.ALLOWED_ORIGINS || "")
  .split(",")
  .map(s => s.trim())
  .filter(Boolean);

function isAllowed(origin?: string) {
  if (!origin) return true; // same-origin/curl
  if (allowList.includes(origin)) return true;
  if (origin.endsWith(".netlify.app")) return true; // allow deploy previews too
  return false;
}

app.use(cors({
  origin: (origin, cb) => cb(isAllowed(origin) ? null : new Error("Not allowed by CORS"), isAllowed(origin)),
  credentials: true,
  methods: ["GET","POST","PUT","DELETE","OPTIONS"],
  allowedHeaders: ["Content-Type", "Authorization", "x-session-token"],
}));
5) Render: environment variable
In Render → your service → Environment add/confirm:
ALLOWED_ORIGINS = https://begc-financialmanagementsystem.netlify.app
(Your exact Netlify URL; you can add more, comma-separated)
Then click Save and Manual Deploy.
