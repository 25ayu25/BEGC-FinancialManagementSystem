Make the Financial Summary card easy to scan for first-time viewers by creating a clear starting point and stronger grouping.
Do this
Create a clear “start here”
Add a top KPI strip with three small tiles: Net income (primary), Revenue, Expenses.
Net income should be the most prominent of the three.
Strengthen grouping
Visually separate the three columns into distinct sub-panels: Income sources, Expenses, Performance.
Add soft background and inner padding to each panel so they read as different sections.
Keep Filter and Compare buttons out of this card (place them in the page toolbar/top-right).
Emphasize totals
Make “Total revenue” and “Total expenses” stand out with bolder weight and a subtle highlight row.
Right-align all numbers; use monospaced/tabular numerals for perfect column alignment.
Reduce cognitive load
Use one base currency by default (SSP). If other currencies appear, add a short helper note: “All values in SSP unless noted,” and show the conversion in a tooltip.
Keep labels short and secondary (lighter color); keep values larger and primary.
Limit decimals (0 unless needed).
Add a readable flow
Reading order should be: Top KPIs → Income → Expenses → Performance (left to right).
Add subtle vertical dividers between columns on desktop.
Clarify performance metrics
Add tiny tooltips or “i” icons explaining formulas (e.g., Profit margin = Net income ÷ Revenue).
Show changes with both color and an up/down arrow (not color alone).
Microcopy consistency
Card title: Financial summary
Subtitle under it: Key financials · {range} (e.g., “Key financials · Last 3 months”).
Acceptance checklist

Totals are immediately noticeable and aligned.
No action buttons inside the summary card.
Numbers are right-aligned, easy to compare, and consistently formatted.
Currency usage is obvious; mixed-currency handling is explained.
Performance metrics are understandable via tooltips and arrows.
