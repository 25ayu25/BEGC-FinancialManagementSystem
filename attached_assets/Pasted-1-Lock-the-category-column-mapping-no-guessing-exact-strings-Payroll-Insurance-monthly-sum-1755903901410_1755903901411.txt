1) Lock the category → column mapping (no guessing, exact strings):
Payroll & Insurance (monthly sums)
Clinic = Clinic Operations
Doctors = Doctor Payments
Lab Techs = Lab Tech Payments
Radiographer = Radiographer Payments
Insurance = Insurance Payments (display label: “Insurance”)
Operating Expenses (one row per category; exclude the five above to avoid double-counting)
Staff Salaries
Drugs Purchased
Lab Reagents
Equipment
Landlord
Utilities
Sono Papers
X-Ray Films
Other
2) Date filter (monthly): use start = first day 00:00 and end = first day of next month 00:00, and date >= start AND date < end (avoid timezone off-by-one).
3) Data rules:
Type = expense only.
For Operating Expenses, do NOT include any of the five payroll/insurance categories.
It’s OK if some categories sum to 0—either (a) hide zero rows or (b) always show all rows; pick one behavior and keep it consistent.
4) Formatting (keep it simple):
Right-align all money cells; thousand separators (e.g., SSP 26,900).
Use tabular numerals (tabular-nums) so columns line up.
Table order exactly as listed above.
Add a TOTAL row at the bottom of each table.
Add GRAND TOTAL EXPENSES = Payroll & Insurance total + Operating Expenses total under the two tables.
5) No daily breakdowns; monthly sums only.
60-second acceptance check (what I’ll look for)
Payroll & Insurance shows 5 columns plus a TOTAL that matches the sum of those columns.
Operating Expenses lists only the “other” categories (no doctor/lab/radiographer/clinic/insurance rows).
GRAND TOTAL EXPENSES equals the “Total Expenses (SSP)” in the Financial Summary at the top of the PDF.
Amounts are right-aligned with commas; numbers align in neat columns.
Regenerating the PDF after adding a small test expense to, say, Staff Salaries makes that row appear with the correct sum.
If, after adding a small test expense in Staff Salaries for this month, the row still doesn’t appear, the mapping is wrong. Fix by comparing the exact label saved in transactions vs. the strings listed above—no plurals/typos/case differences.
